# omeka2hugo/ — converter artifacts

This directory is written by `omeka-to-hugo` for the site **hurricanearchive**
(`https://hurricanearchive.org`). It holds everything the converter produces that is *not* part of
the Hugo source tree. Hugo ignores it, so it never appears in the rendered
`public/` output.

Everything here is **deterministic**: byte-identical across re-runs unless the
source dump (or the captured theme) actually changed. That makes a `git diff` of
this directory a precise record of what each conversion changed.

## Files

- **conversion-manifest.json** — every output path the converter wrote, each
  with its SHA-256, plus per-phase counts, the missing-asset total, and
  ``missing_assets_by_parent`` (that total bucketed by the parent dir of each
  miss, e.g. ``files/original`` vs ``files/thumbnails``). Use it to see what
  changed between runs and as a CI summary. (The manifest and the
  missing-assets log are written directly and are not themselves listed inside
  the manifest, to avoid self-reference.)
- **missing-assets.log** — tab-separated list of binary files (images, PDFs,
  audio) that the content references but that were absent from the wget mirror at
  conversion time. Columns: `<absolute-url>\t<referencing-item-id>\t`
  `<expected-on-disk-path>`. Sorted and deduplicated, so a diff surfaces only
  genuinely new misses. Recover by fetching the URLs from the live origin into
  the mirror and re-running.
- **redirects.txt** — legacy Omeka URL rules that Hugo aliases can't express: browse/list endpoints (`/items/browse`, `/collections/browse`, `/tags/browse`) and query-string facets (`?collection=<id>`, `?tags=<name>`). Format `<from>\t<to>\t<status>`, sorted. The header comment shows how to translate the rules into Caddy, nginx, or a Netlify `_redirects` file at deploy time. Per-item and per-collection legacy URLs are handled by Hugo aliases instead and are not duplicated here.
- **theme/** — original-frontend matching kit (theme: **hurricane**). Deterministic, offline inputs for reproducing the original site's look on the Hugo site: the parsed theme options, the canonical metadata field order, the reconstructed navigation, the HTML class contract the original CSS targets, a verbatim copy of the theme stylesheet (when available), and a sample of URLs for the verification harness. See `theme/README.md`.

## Re-running

Re-run the same `omeka-to-hugo` command to refresh these artifacts. The
converter only rewrites files whose bytes changed, so a no-op re-run leaves this
directory untouched.
